# Mask Delivery

## About
Project made for Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agents Systems course. It consists on a simulation of a mask distribution service, with the objective of better understanding the
impact that masks can have in the virusâ€™s spread and to analyse the best strategies that can be used for performing such a task. It has three different implementations for the agents responsible for distributing the masks: reactive without internal state, reactive with internal state and reinforcement learning based.

### Instructions
1. Open the MaskDelivery.exe file;
2. In the menu, tick one of the boxes according to the agent you want (not ticking will result in a reactive agent with no internal state):
   - RL agent: agent trained using Reinforcement Learning;
   - Internal state: purely reactive agent with an internal state;
3. Insert the number of nurse, infected and patient agents;
4. Choose the probability of an agent getting infected by using the slider;
5. Hit "Play" and click on the "Hide" button to watch the simulation run.
